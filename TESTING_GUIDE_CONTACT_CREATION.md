## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Contact Creation from Incoming Message

**Objective:** Verify that a new contact is created when receiving a message from an unknown number.

**Steps:**
1. Open the WhatsApp messages page in the browser
2. Open browser console (F12) and go to Console tab
3. Note the current number of contacts in the contact list
4. From a NEW phone number (not in contacts), send a WhatsApp message to your business number
5. Message content: "Test message 1"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Within 1-2 seconds, a new contact appears in the contact list
- ✅ Contact shows the phone number as the name
- ✅ Contact appears at the top of the list
- ✅ Message appears when you click on the contact
- ✅ No page refresh required

**Console Logs to Verify:**
```
📱 New contact created: {contact: {...}}
✅ Adding new contact to list: [PHONE_NUMBER]
📨 New message received: {message: {...}}
✅ Message added to state: [MESSAGE_ID]
```

**Backend Logs to Verify:**
```
📱 Created new contact: [PHONE_NUMBER] for session [SESSION_ID]
📱 Broadcasted new contact for session: [SESSION_ID], phone: [PHONE_NUMBER]
💬 Broadcasted new message for session: [SESSION_ID]
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Contact appears in list within 2 seconds
- [ ] Message is visible in conversation
- [ ] Console shows WebSocket events received
- [ ] Backend logs show contact creation and broadcast

---

### Test 2: Multiple Messages from Same New Contact

**Objective:** Verify that multiple messages from the same new contact don't create duplicate contacts.

**Steps:**
1. Complete Test 1 first
2. From the SAME phone number, send a second message: "Test message 2"
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. Send a third message: "Test message 3"
5. Wait 2 seconds

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No duplicate contacts are created
- ✅ All three messages appear in the conversation
- ✅ Contact's last message is updated to "Test message 3"
- ✅ Contact remains at the top of the list

**Console Logs to Verify:**
```
📨 New message received: {message: {...}}
✅ Message added to state: [MESSAGE_ID]
⏭️ Contact already exists, skipping: [PHONE_NUMBER]
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Only one contact exists for the phone number
- [ ] All messages are visible in order
- [ ] Last message is displayed correctly
- [ ] No duplicate contact warnings in console

---

### Test 3: Contact Creation with WebSocket Disconnection

**Objective:** Verify fallback mechanism when WebSocket is temporarily disconnected.

**Steps:**
1. Open browser console
2. In console, run: `socket.disconnect()` (if socket is exposed) OR disable internet briefly
3. From a NEW phone number, send a message
4. Re-enable internet or reconnect WebSocket
5. Wait 5 seconds

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Contact is created when WebSocket reconnects
- ✅ Message appears in conversation
- ✅ Temporary contact may be created immediately (fallback)
- ✅ Backend-created contact replaces temporary one

**Console Logs to Verify:**
```
❌ WebSocket disconnected
📱 Creating temporary contact for new message from: [PHONE_NUMBER]
✅ WebSocket reconnected
📱 New contact created: {contact: {...}}
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Contact appears even with temporary disconnection
- [ ] Message is not lost
- [ ] No duplicate contacts after reconnection

---

### Test 4: Existing Contact Receives Message

**Objective:** Verify that messages from existing contacts don't create duplicates.

**Steps:**
1. Identify an EXISTING contact in your contact list
2. From that phone number, send a message: "Test from existing contact"
3. Observe the UI

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No new contact is created
- ✅ Message appears immediately in conversation
- ✅ Contact's last message is updated
- ✅ Contact moves to top of list (if not already there)

**Console Logs to Verify:**
```
📨 New message received: {message: {...}}
✅ Message added to state: [MESSAGE_ID]
⏭️ Contact already exists, skipping: [PHONE_NUMBER]
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Contact count remains the same
- [ ] Message appears in existing conversation
- [ ] No duplicate contact created

---

### Test 5: Rapid Multiple New Contacts

**Objective:** Verify system handles multiple new contacts simultaneously.

**Steps:**
1. Prepare 3 different NEW phone numbers
2. Within 10 seconds, send messages from all 3 numbers
3. Observe the contact list

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All 3 contacts are created
- ✅ All 3 messages are visible
- ✅ No duplicates
- ✅ Contacts appear in order of message receipt

**Console Logs to Verify:**
```
📱 New contact created: {contact: {phoneNumber: "NUMBER1"}}
📱 New contact created: {contact: {phoneNumber: "NUMBER2"}}
📱 New contact created: {contact: {phoneNumber: "NUMBER3"}}
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] All 3 contacts appear
- [ ] All 3 messages are visible
- [ ] No race conditions or duplicates
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### Issue: Contact Not Appearing

**Check:**
1. Backend logs for contact creation message
2. WebSocket connection status in browser console
3. Network tab for WebSocket frames
4. Database for contact record

**Solutions:**
- Verify WhatsApp session is connected
- Check WebSocket authentication
- Restart backend server
- Clear browser cache and reload

---

### Issue: Message Not Appearing

**Check:**
1. Backend logs for message processing
2. Console for message received event
3. Selected contact matches message sender
4. Message direction (inbound/outbound)

**Solutions:**
- Verify message handler is registered
- Check phone number formatting
- Verify message is saved in database
- Check message filtering logic

---

### Issue: Duplicate Contacts

**Check:**
1. Console for duplicate detection logs
2. Database for multiple records with same phone number
3. Phone number cleaning logic

**Solutions:**
- Check unique constraint on phone number
- Verify cleanPhoneNumber function
- Check contact comparison logic
- Run database cleanup script

---

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
- **Contact Creation Time:** < 2 seconds
- **Message Display Time:** < 1 second
- **WebSocket Event Latency:** < 500ms
- **UI Update Time:** < 100ms

### Monitoring
```javascript
// Add to browser console for performance monitoring
let startTime = Date.now();
socket.on('new_contact', () => {
  console.log(`Contact event received in ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);
});
```

---

## 🛠️ Automated Testing

### Using the Test Script

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install axios socket.io-client
   ```

2. **Update test configuration:**
   Edit `test-contact-creation.js`:
   ```javascript
   const TEST_USER = {
     email: 'your-email@example.com',
     password: 'your-password'
   };
   
   const TEST_NUMBERS = {
     sessionNumber: 'YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER',
     newContact: 'TEST_PHONE_NUMBER',
   };
   ```

3. **Run the test:**
   ```bash
   node test-contact-creation.js
   ```

4. **Follow on-screen instructions:**
   - Send test message when prompted
   - Wait for results
   - Check test summary
